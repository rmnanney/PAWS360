This file contains suppressions for known false positives in dependency vulnerability scanning.
Each suppression should include a justification and review date.

    Example suppression for test-only dependencies that may have vulnerabilities
    but don't affect production security:
    
    <suppress>
        <notes><![CDATA[
        TestContainers dependency only used in test scope, not in production.
        Vulnerability does not affect test execution security.
        Review Date: 2024-11-07

        <packageUrl regex="true">^pkg:maven/org\.testcontainers/.*@.*$</packageUrl>
        <cve>CVE-2023-XXXXX</cve>

    <!-- 
    Suppress vulnerabilities in Spring Boot Test dependencies that are test-scoped
    -->
    <suppress>
        <notes><![CDATA[
        Spring Boot Test dependencies are only used during testing phase.
        These vulnerabilities do not impact production deployment.

    Suppress PostgreSQL test driver vulnerabilities that don't affect test execution

        PostgreSQL driver used only for TestContainers in isolated test environment.
        Production uses different connection pooling and security configurations.

    <!--
    Note: This suppressions file follows the principle of minimal suppressions.
    Only suppress vulnerabilities that:
    1. Are confirmed false positives
    2. Affect test-only dependencies
    3. Have documented justification and review dates
    4. Include plan for resolution or monitoring
    
    Constitutional Article V requires comprehensive security testing while avoiding
    false positive noise that could mask real security issues.
