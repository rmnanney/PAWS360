DISABLED: Duplicate workflow from earlier iteration. This file is disabled because `ci.yml` is the canonical workflow.

This copy is intentionally disabled to keep historical context — it should not be active in GitHub Actions.
### Disabled workflow — moved to `.github/workflows/ci.yml` as canonical
### This file was previously used for CI but has been disabled and is kept for historical context.
