## Contributor Ownership & Last Touch (Unified)

This section combines `git blame` (last-touch) analysis with historical contribution data to clarify current ownership and recent responsibility for files and areas of the codebase.

> Note: "Last touch" indicates the most recent commit that touched a file and is not necessarily the only owner or sole maintainer—see the per-contributor activity sections above for historical context.

### Ownership Summary (by area)
- **Backend Controllers**: UserController last touched by `Ryan Nanney` (observability/control flow). Course, enrollment, advising, finances, and academics controllers were last touched primarily by `Zack` and `Randall-S4` in their respective domains.
- **Backend Services**: Core services (UserService, Enrollment/Academics/Finances/Advising) are primarily maintained by `Zack`. Observability and session management services were last touched by `Ryan`.
- **Entities/DTOs**: The majority of domain models and DTOs are owned and last touched by `Zack` (users, courses, academics, finances, advising). `Ryan` owns a small set of base entities and session-related entities.
- **Frontend Pages/Components**: The UI component library and many pages were implemented and last touched by `Zenith` and `Randall-S4` (homepage, Card, Header, LoginForm, ThemeToggle), while pages for courses/advising/academics/finances were last touched by `Zack`.
- **CI/CD & Workflows**: All GitHub Actions workflow files and CI configurations were last touched by `Ryan Nanney`.

### Last Touch by File Type (summary)
- Java Controllers: majority last modified by `Zack`, `Ryan`, `Ryan Nanney`, and `Randall-S4` as indicated in the per-file analysis.
- Java Services: `Zack` and `Ryan` split responsibilities; `Zack` for business logic, `Ryan` for auth/health/session services.
- Java Entities/DTOs/Repos: mostly `Zack`.
- Frontend Pages/Components: `Zenith`, `Randall-S4`, `Zack`, and `Ryan` depending on area.
- Workflows & CI: `Ryan Nanney`.

### Noise and Caveats
- Some file-type counts are inflated by committed build outputs (`.next/*`) and vendored dependencies (`tests/ui/node_modules/*`); those should be excluded when assessing code ownership.
- Last touch does not imply exclusive ownership — follow-up commits, refactors, or test updates by others may indicate collaborative ownership.

### How to interpret this document
- Use `Key functionality introduced` (per contributor) to understand intent and scope of historical work.
- Use `Contributor Ownership` and `Last Touch` to assign responsibility for code areas and drive question/PR review assignments.
- Consult `git blame` on specific files for the most granular, per-line ownership.

---

If you'd like, I can produce a CSV mapping of path → last-touch author → last-touch date for all files (noise-filtered) or a simplified ownership report per top-level module (backend/frontend/infra/tests/CI) for quick assignment.
